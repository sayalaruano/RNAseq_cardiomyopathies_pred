## **Credits**

- This app was developed for a group project of a course from the [Master's degree in Systems Biology](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/systems-biology) at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).
- Developed by [Sebasti√°n Ayala Ruano](https://sayalaruano.github.io/).
- The training [dataset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE141910) was obtained from the The [Myocardial Applied Genomics Network (MAGNet)](https://www.med.upenn.edu/magnet/) project.
